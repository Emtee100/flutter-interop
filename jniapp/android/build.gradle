// This file is to help tools like jnigen that might expect a Groovy-based build.gradle
// at the Android project root. Your main Android project configuration
// remains in build.gradle.kts.

//    implementation "androidx.health.connect:connect-client:1.1.0-rc01" // Or the latest stable/desired version
//}

// If jnigen or other tools need to inject Groovy-specific configurations
// at this root level (e.g., into an 'allprojects' or 'subprojects' block),
// they might attempt to do so here.
// However, most modern tools and jnigen's dependency/source additions
// typically target the app-level build.gradle (e.g., android/app/build.gradle).
